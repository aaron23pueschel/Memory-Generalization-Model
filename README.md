# Memory Generalization Model
### This is the model implementation for Sanjay Narasiwodeyars' PhD Dissertation. This is a model uses maximum likelihood to measure the direction of maximal orientation in a network of neurons with preferred orientation. At the present, this model is implemented without noise, and with only a single layer. The .ipynb files within this repository are tests with different tuning parameters for the neurons as well as 2 different implementations of the maximum likelihood algorithm
